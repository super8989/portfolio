				I have a background in chemistry and fashion. I cleaned dozens of hotel
				rooms at Disney World. I taught English in Korea. I was a radio news
				anchor. I managed a convenience store. But best of all, I am a happy
				family man.

			<h2>I wanted to be part of the change shaping our future.</h2>

				I wanted to solve problems and create solutions. I realized tech was
				where I wanted to be so I sought out to be a developer. After 2 years of
				self-learning to code, I immersed myself in Lighthouse Labs' Web
				Development Bootcamp and now I am ready to start my journey as a Junior
				Full Stack Developer.

				I love React and I love JavaScript. Believe it or not, coding is my

				never pass up on spending time with my family.
