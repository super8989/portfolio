				I have a background in chemistry and fashion. I interned at Disney World Resort. I taught English in Korea. I was a radio news
				anchor. I managed a convenience store. But best of all, I am a happy

				I wanted to solve problems and create solutions. I realized tech was
				where I wanted to be so I sought out to be a developer. After 2 years of
				self-learning to code, I immersed myself in Lighthouse Labs' Web
				Development Bootcamp and now I am ready to start my journey as a Junior
				Full Stack Developer.
